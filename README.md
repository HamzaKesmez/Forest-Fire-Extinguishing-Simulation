This project is a Windows Forms application designed to simulate the process of extinguishing forest fires. The application uses a graph-based representation of a forest, where regions are connected with weighted edges representing distances. Each region has specific fire intensity levels, requiring water and fuel resources to extinguish.

The application leverages Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path to fire-affected regions, ensuring efficient and optimal resource utilization. The system monitors and manages resources such as water and fuel, with automated refilling at the base station when necessary.

The application also features a dynamic map interface that visualizes the forest, including the aircraft's current location, fire intensity levels, and extinguished regions. Upon completing the simulation, the system generates a comprehensive report summarizing metrics such as total water usage, fuel consumption, and overall firefighting performance.

This simulation integrates algorithmic precision with user-friendly visualization, offering a practical tool for exploring resource management and emergency response strategies in firefighting scenarios.
